## About the Book

I taught myself to program back in the dark days of C# 1.0 in 2002, right after its release.  I didn't have anyone to guide me on how best to learn the language.  My only prior programming experience was with Perl 5.  This is the book I wished to have when I started programming.

It's audience is brand new programmers and people who have been coding C# for a while and wish to enhance their skills by learning not just _what_ to type into a text editor, but _why_ they are typing the things they are.

__This book requires Visual Studio for Mac \(v. 8.3.2+, any edition\) ___or___ Visual Studio 2019 \(v. 16.3.5+, any edition\) ___and___ the latest public release of the .NET Core SDK 3.x.  The samples in this book have been tested on Windows and macOS.  Visual Studio Code with the required plugins may also be used, but Visual Studio's Community Editions are freely available for Windows and macOS free for education or non-commercial use and are recommended for ease of use.__

Estimated completion date: December, 2019.  The book __may__ be updated for C# 8.1 if its feature set is defined soon enough.
