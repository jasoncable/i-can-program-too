# I Can Program Too
__by Jason L. Cable__

Recently upon reviewing books that teach programming to children, I discovered a few problems.  The first is that many of the basic pieces of information are just plain missing.  Everyone should know a little bit about the history of computing.  I also believe that these books start too quickly.  They explain the concept of a variable in one sentence then go straight into crafting code.  You have to know about the basics to become a _good_ programmer.

I did knew very little when I taught myself to program.  Knowing some of the basics would have helped.  I would like to teach people like I would have been taught.
