## About the Book

I taught myself to program back in the dark days of C# 1.0 in 2002, right after its release.  I didn't have anyone to guide me on how best to learn the language.  My only prior programming experience was with Perl 5.  This is the book I wished to have when I started programming.

It's audience is brand new programmers and people who have been coding C# for a while and wish to enhance their skills by learning not just _what_ to type into a text editor, but _why_ they are typing the things they are.

__AS OF 3/3/2019, this REQUIRES .NET Core SDK 3, the latest preview edition, and Visual Studio 2019's latest release candidate on WINDOWS.  Visual Studio for Mac 2019 does not seem to have a firm release date yet.__

Estimated completion date: June, 2019.  This assumes that C# 8.0's new features are solidified by the end of March.
