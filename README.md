# Discover Programming with C#
## Featuring .NET Core 3 & C# 8
__by Jason L. Cable__

Recently upon reviewing books that teach programming to children, I discovered a few problems.  The first is that many of the basic pieces of information are just plain missing.  Everyone should know a little bit about the history of computing.  I also believe that these books start too quickly.  They explain the concept of a variable in one sentence then go straight into crafting code.  You have to know about the basics to become a _good_ programmer.

I did knew very little when I taught myself to program.  Knowing some of the basics would have helped.  I would like to teach people like I would have been taught.

__Featuring C# 8 and .NET Core 3.0__

__AS OF 1/3/2019, this REQUIRES .NET Core SDK 3.0.100-preview-009812 in Visual Studio 2019 Preview 1 on WINDOWS.  Visual Studio for Mac does not currently support C# 8.0 syntax.__

Estimated completion date: June, 2019.
