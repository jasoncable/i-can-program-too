# Legal Matter

### Author's Note

I have made every attempt to ascertain whether a name used in this book is a registered trademark in the United States.  Unfortunately, that can be a very difficult task, considering the woefully outdated means provided by the US Patent & Trademark Office of searching trademarks.  Also, few companies have precise information on their websites regarding the usage of their trademarked names in publications.  In a few cases, it is uncertain as to the official name of a product.  Microsoft, for example, is in the terrible habit of changing the names of their products.  At times, they include their company name in the name of the product.  For example, they used to exclusively call their relational database product "Microsoft SQL Server".  In all of their recent literature and marketing materials, it is simply "SQL Server".  Which is correct?  I have no idea.

In any case, I have made my best attempt at figuring out the current ownership of certain products and services.  If I have left anything out, it was not intentional.  Any trademarked used in this book that is not listed below is registered by its respective owner in its respective jurisdiction.
