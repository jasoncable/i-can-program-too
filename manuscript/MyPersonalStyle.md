You may prefer other things, but I generally follow these practices. 

### Spaces vs. Tabs

I use indentation of 4 spaces.

### Namespaces

For personal projects, I start namespaces with `JasonCable.`

### Life Lesson

Don't assume that everyone is looking at your code in the same IDE that you use.  They can vary wildly, even between two versions of the same IDE.  Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 to 2010 was a huge upgrade that included a rewrite from Win32 C++ to WPF.

If you publish your code on a place like GitHub, people may be reading it on the web with vastly different syntax highlighting from Visual Studio to make a difference.

If contributing to open source, follow their formatting rules.  Remember, some people like tabs!
