This book is being published in stages.  The writing is not exactly linear.  I am trying to go through the key functionality that I want to cover, then backfill with expanded examples and exercises.  The following is a partial todo list.

A> **Update as of 2019-10-18**
A>
A> * Visual Studio 2019, Visual Studio for Mac, and .NET Core 3.0 have been released since the bulk of this book was written.  I will be updating it to the released C# 8.1 and .NET Core 3.0 feature set immediately.

### High Level Todo List

* Add more new features of C# 8 and .NET Core 3.
* Test every line of code in C# 8.0 and .NET Core 3.0 \(RTM, not just preview versions\).
* Restructure existing tests to align with new chapter numbers.
* Decide whether the difference between the words "parameter" and "argument" are significant.
* Revisit nullable reference types and their usage.
* More use of the `var` keyword.
* Backfill with more quotes from important computer scientists.
* A full edit and review.
* Optionally, illustrations and diagrams, as time and finances permit.
* Basic Visual Studio usage and screenshots on Windows and macOS.
* Test the epub, mobi, and web versions of the book.
* Up the DPI of Visual Studio screenshots and re-take.
* ValueTuples
* Pagination.
* __SEE ALSO__ `TODO.md` in the repo as it is more frequently updated.

### Excluded on Purpose

* `unsafe` code.
* How to mutate strings.
* `ArrayList` and `Hashtable` objects, prefer generic types.
* Floating point numbers.
* Old school threading, prefer async/await, etc.
* `Tuple` object.
* Anything listed in the "Reusable Components" appendix.
* XML and JSON handling.
* Code signing and obfuscation.
