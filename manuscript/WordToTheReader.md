Learning to program is actually not hard.  It takes creativity, patience, and practice.  It also takes an active mind and a willingness to fail.  This book doesn't just teach you what to type into the computer.  If you apply yourself you will learn _why_ you type those things into the computer.  A good programmer always knows _why_.  I can't promise that you will become a rockstar, but you will understand what it takes to become one.  This is just a starting point and I encourage you to continue your study of programming.
