# About the Author

Jason L. Cable is a full-stack .NET developer residing in Pittsburgh, PA.  He has specialized in C# since its release in 2002.  Jason has diverse experience in the Information Technology field.  He started in 1996 at the age of 16 as a telephone technical support specialist with a local internet service provider.  He has worked as UNIX/Linux systems administrator, Windows desktop support technician, Windows system administrator, webmaster specializing in Perl development, SQL Server DBA, development team lead and manager, and full-stack .NET web developer.  Jason also has experience in DevOps, networking architecture, software architecture and best practices, and cloud computing.

Jason is a strong believer in open source software and the elimination of software patents.  The internet pioneers were unencumbered by the limits of the patent system.  Without their ability to publicly publish their ideas and collaborate with peers, Jason feels that we would not enjoy the benefits of an open internet that we have today.

Outside of his professional life, Jason is a big fan of Star Trek.  He enjoys old movies and many types of music.  He is a supporter of classical music and believes that the elimination of music and art education programs in the public schools is harmful to society.  Jason also enjoys reading and spending time with his cat Spot.

Jason has a Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology from Ashford University.
